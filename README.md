## Data Processing and Analysis Project
This project includes multiple scripts, notebooks, and datasets related to data cleaning, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization. It combines elements of Python programming, data science, and basic web output.

## 🗂️ Contents
## 📊 Datasets
Applications.xlsx – Raw application data.

house_prices.csv, QueryResults.csv, tested.csv – Datasets used for analysis.

b_depressed.csv – Dataset likely containing mental health or behavioral data, used for sentiment or psychological analysis.

Covid_daily_data.csv – COVID-19 daily statistics, possibly used for time series or epidemiological trend analysis.

## 📒 Notebooks
data_cleaning.ipynb – Notebook for cleaning and preparing data.

data_preprocessing.ipynb – Notebook focusing on feature selection and preprocessing.

priyanshu.ipynb – Main analysis and modeling notebook.

priyanshu_NLP.ipynb – NLP-specific notebook, likely used for text analysis.

priyanshu_graph.ipynb – Contains graphs or visualizations of the data.

Day_6.ipynb to Day_11.ipynb – Daily analysis notebooks, likely representing progressive stages of a project or a training schedule, covering topics such as EDA, modeling, or visual analytics.

Day_9(self).ipynb, Day_10(self_2).ipynb – Self-assigned or advanced versions of daily notebooks, used for independent practice or customized analysis.

*Project-1 : This Project is performed for all the datascience realated tasks using b_depressed.csv dataset.*

*Project-2 : This Project is performed for all the datascience realated tasks using Covid_daily_data.csv dataset.*

🐍 Scripts
Priyanshu_QueryResult.py – Python script to process and analyze data programmatically.

🌐 HTML & Output Files
priyanshu.prn – Output or result file (possibly from an external tool or system).

priyanshu.html, social_media.html – HTML output or interface files, possibly generated from notebooks.

## 🔧 Requirements

To run the notebooks and scripts, install the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
