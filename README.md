# Data Processing and Analysis Project

This project includes multiple scripts, notebooks, and datasets related to data cleaning, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization. It combines elements of Python programming, data science, and basic web output.

## 🗂️ Contents

- **Applications.xlsx** – Raw application data.
- **house_prices.csv**, **QueryResults.csv**, **tested.csv** – Datasets used for analysis.
- **data_cleaning.ipynb** – Notebook for cleaning and preparing data.
- **data_preprocessing.ipynb** – Notebook focusing on feature selection and preprocessing.
- **priyanshu.ipynb** – Main analysis and modeling notebook.
- **Priyanshu_QueryResult.py** – Python script to process and analyze data programmatically.
- **priyanshu_NLP.ipynb** – NLP-specific notebook, likely used for text analysis.
- **priyanshu_graph.ipynb** – Contains graphs or visualizations of the data.
- **priyanshu.prn** – Output or result file (possibly from an external tool or system).
- **priyanshu.html**, **social_media.html** – HTML output or interface files.

## 🔧 Requirements
